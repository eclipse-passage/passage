/**
 * <p>
 * Represent a library's licensing aspect for an owning product.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementation must be stateless: service is to be instantiated as many times
 * as it is appealed to, no caching to perform for scanned extensions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A library appeals to it's own standalone {@linkplain Framewrok} instance when
 * checks license coverage for its features. Nothing to be contributed to the
 * product {@code access cycle} for this scenario.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * However, a library should participate in
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * 
 * <li>1. the owning product license coverage assessment</li>
 * 
 * <li>2. bulk license import (prevent end user from dealing with all the
 * product-libraries relations)</li>
 * 
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * smoothly, so it should
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * 
 * <li>1.1. supply it's own assessment results when asked: {@code access()}</li>
 * 
 * <li>1.2. facilitate acceptance of a license agreement, in case it demands
 * some for acceptance:
 * {@code agreementsService(AgreementToAccept agreement)}</li>
 * 
 * <li>2.1. supply a {@linkplain LicenseReadingService} that will read licensing
 * {@linkplain Condition}s from a license file, in case it can be treated a this
 * library's license</li>
 * 
 * <li>2.2. provide a way to install a license (it defined to be this library's
 * license) to path configured for the library as <i>license residence</i>:
 * {@code installLicense(Path license)}.</li>
 * 
 * </ul>
